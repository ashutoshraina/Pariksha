Pariksha
========
Pariksha is a small project to understand EF6 and implement the repository pattern.
* The idea is to see what can or cannot be done.
* To understand the limitations and the limits of this approach.
* To see what are the pros and cons of the approach.
* Also learn more about git.
* And hopefully have some fun along the way :).
